## IRIS Flower Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for classifying the IRIS flower dataset using various machine learning algorithms. The project aims to demonstrate the application of classification techniques to predict the species of iris flowers based on their features.

## Description

The IRIS flower dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It consists of 150 samples from three species of iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica) with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. This project explores different classification algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines, to accurately classify the iris species based on the provided features.

## Installation

To run the Jupyter Notebook, you need to have Python installed along with Jupyter Notebook and the required libraries. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IRIS_FLOWER_CLASSIFICATION.git
cd IRIS_FLOWER_CLASSIFICATION
```

## Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to execute the classification algorithms. You can visualize the results and see how different models perform on the dataset.

```bash
jupyter notebook IRIS_FLOWER_CLASSIFICATION.ipynb
```

## Data Description

The dataset includes the following columns:

- **Sepal Length**: Length of the sepal in centimeters.
- **Sepal Width**: Width of the sepal in centimeters.
- **Petal Length**: Length of the petal in centimeters.
- **Petal Width**: Width of the petal in centimeters.
- **Species**: The species of the iris flower (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, Iris virginica).

## Algorithms Used

This project implements the following classification algorithms:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Each algorithm is evaluated based on accuracy and other performance metrics.
